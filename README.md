## 🧮 How It Works

- Input data for each sale: Month, Product, Store Cost, Sale Price, Salesperson, Location, etc.
- Excel calculates:
  - **Profit** = Sale Price − Store Cost  
  - **Commission** = 10% or 20% using the `IF` formula based on cost
- Use `SUMIF` to generate total commissions/sales by person or product
- Use **Filters** to view specific data (e.g., sales in Jan, by Chalie, etc.)
- Create **Pivot Tables** to summarize totals
- Build **Pie Charts** from pivot tables for visual analysis
